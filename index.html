      <h1>Ahmet Selim ÇEVİK</h1>
      <p>
        I wrote my first line of code at age 10, driven by curiosity about how computers and video games worked.
        My main passion is computer graphics and game development.
        I also enjoy exploring low-level systems such as programming languages, operating systems and emulators.
        Over the years, I've witnessed the evolution of 3D graphics and turned that fascination into both personal projects and professional work.

        On this page, you'll find a selection of both;
        professional projects that reflect real-world collaboration and
        personal projects where I've delved into the inner workings of computers and explored various system architectures.

              A strategy action RPG developed by TaleWorlds Entertainment.
              As an engine programmer, I helped maintain and optimize the in-house game engine from early access through to full release.
              I worked closely with design and art teams to support specialized needs and ensure engine stability across large-scale battles and sandbox simulation.
            </p>
            <p>
              A major focus of my work was improving modding tools used by both artists and scene designers.
              Since the engine supports extensive modding, these tools were also exposed to the community.
              I was responsible for receiving and implementing feature requests from both internal teams and external modders.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the project, I also supported the game's console ports by addressing platform-specific issues and performance bottlenecks.
              Profiling and optimization were an ongoing and critical part of my role.
            </p>

              Official Hot Wheels Roblox game developed by Mildmania and Gamefam Studios in partnership with Mattel.
              As a game programmer, I implemented core gameplay mechanics and open-world systems using Lua.
              I worked with an international team and maintained regular communication with brand representatives to align features with brand vision.
            </p>
            <p>
            Due to the scale and ambition of the project, many of Roblox's built-in tools were either limited, unsuitable or entirely missing for our needs.
            I was primarily responsible for developing custom tools and systems to tailor the platform to the requirements of a large-scale, professional game.

              A cross-platform C++ game engine originally created to explore spatially non-Euclidean puzzle design.

            </p>
            <p>
              After implementing the core systems, I've decided to participate in game jams to iteratively validate and improve the engine.
              This workflow has enabled rapid prototyping and made the core engine production-ready.

              A cycle-accurate NES emulator built from scratch in C++, using OpenGL for video output.
              Ongoing development is focused on extending ROM mapper support beyond NROM and implementing PRG-RAM save functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The emulator includes a comprehensive debugger suite allowing inspection of both the emulator internals and the games it runs.
              Features include a CPU debugger for step-through intstruction execution and a visual debugger that displays pattern tables, palettes and nametables.
            </p>
            <p>
              The hardware components are implemented in compliance with their technical reference manuals.
              Additional features (e.g. Ricoh 2A03 modifications to the 6502) are implemented separately.
              This allows hardware to be potentially reused in other emulators (e.g. Apple II, Atari 8-bit, Commodore 64).

              A toy operating system built from scratch in x86 assembly.
              It has a minimal shell with basic command support that can perform BIOS-based I/O operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              It supports booting from USB, physical disk or virtual disk.
              The bootstrap process begins with the bootloader, performing sanity checks before loading the kernel and launching the shell.
              Currently, the shell runs in real mode, with the foundation for switching to protected mode already in place and the A20 line is enabled.

            <p>
              This project serves as an in-depth exploration of low-level systems programming and hardware interaction.

              A game engine made for the Global Game Jam 2020 with C++, OpenGL, PhysX, Assimp and ImGui.
              The project involved building the core runtime library and collaborating with a small team to create a working game prototype within the jam's time constraints.

              A visual programming language developed as my graduation project.
              Designed to help beginners, particularly middle school students and hobbyists to learn programming concepts with ease.
              The language focuses on simplicity and intuitive design, using a visual interface to teach foundational programming principles without the need for traditional syntax.

              A graphics engine built to demonstrate realistic lighting techniques, implemented with C++ and OpenGL.
              This engine incorporates Physically Based Rendering (PBR) and Image-Based Lighting (IBL), following the UE4 Real Shading Model.
              The rendering pipeline uses the Cook-Torrance BRDF, Trowbridge-Reitz NDF and Smith-Schlick for accurate surface interaction and lighting.

              You are trapped in an ancient maze.
              Every step you take closes off the path behind you.
              You must traverse the entire room to unlock the door.
            </p>
            <p>
              A maze game developed for a university game contest, built using the Borland Graphics Interface - a graphics library from 1987, as a limitation.
              Despite the limitation, I implemented a ray-cast rendering algorithm to convert 2D mazes into 3D FPS-like environments. I also developed the core gameplay mechanics. The game was awarded first place in the contest.
